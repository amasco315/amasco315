## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Andrew, a recent TripleTen graduate pursuing a career in data analysis. 

<p align='left'> HI, I'm Andrew, a data analyst with experience on multiple technical projects on Python, EDA, data visualization, and ML. I am eager to leverage my skills in the professional sphere and help drive informed decisions to help businesses operate as efficiently as possible. 

I have previous experience working for the largest cannabis wholesale distributor in California, where I was conducting large scale inventory analysis to optimize space of the warehouse. There I honed my skills in identifying patterns, and communicating with all departments to minimize errors in their operation. In February of 2024, I enrolled and completed TripleTen's 10 month Data Science program. The curriculum covered Python (Pandas, NumPy), EDA, data visualization (Plotly, Matplotlib, Tableau), Machine Learning (scikit-learn, NLTK), SQL and more. It also included numerous practical projects where I was able to hone my technical skills. 

Some facts about me: 
- I love solving puzzles, which is partially what drove me to an interest in data analysis.
- I enjoy getting out in nature and going for hikes, it is my happy place.
- Skateboarding is my favorite hobby, and I can become obsessive over fine-tuning new tricks and maneuvers; I don't shy away from a challenge. 
- My goals for 2025 are to land a great job in data, and start a family with my wife!
